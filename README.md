# Vision-based Distance and Object Analysis(ViDiAD)
This repository contains the code and resources for the Vision-based Distance and Object Analysis project. The goal of this project is to develop a system that utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze distances between objects and perform object analysis.

## Features
Distance Analysis: The system leverages computer vision algorithms to estimate distances between objects in a scene. This can be achieved through methods such as depth perception, 3D reconstruction, or disparity-based approaches.

Object Analysis: The system incorporates computer vision techniques to analyze and recognize objects within a given scene. This includes object detection, tracking, classification, and .

Applications: The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of objects and their attributes in a scene, which can be utilized in various applications such as robot navigation, intelligent surveillance, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and more.
