# Vision-based Distance and Object Analysis(ViDiAD)
This repository contains the code and resources for the Vision-based Distance and Object Analysis project. The goal of this project is to develop a system that utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze distances between objects and perform object analysis.

# Features
1. Distance Analysis
The system leverages computer vision algorithms to estimate distances between objects in a scene. This can be achieved through depth perception, 3D reconstruction, or disparity-based approaches.

2. Object Analysis
The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze and recognize objects in a scene. This includes object detection, tracking, and classification.

3. Applications
The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of objects and their attributes in a scene, which can be utilized in various applications such as robot navigation, intelligent surveillance, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and more.
